Project Overview: Quality Analysis Dashboard

In this project, I crafted a comprehensive Quality Analysis Dashboard using Power BI, unlocking profound insights from our extensive dataset comprising 2000+ rows distributed across three pivotal tables:-
·     DIM Auditor
·     DIM Emp Masters
·     Fact Quality Data. 
This dynamic dashboard provides a profound lens into our key quality metrics.
 
Data Modeling:
The foundation for seamless analysis was laid through meticulous data modeling. 
Established one-to-many relationships:
·     DIM Emp Master and Fact Quality (EMP ID)
·     DIM Auditor and Fact Quality (Auditor ID)
·     This strategic use of pointers facilitates effortless cross-referencing
 
Key Measures:
·     Total Tasks
·     Total Samples
·     Total Fatal Errors
·     Total Defects
·     Defect Percentage
·     Fatal Percentage
·     Sample Percentage
·     Quality Score
 
Visual Highlights:

Sample Percentages by Auditor to gain diverse perspectives on our data.
ToolTip: Hover over visuals to reveal detailed tooltips, providing nuanced insights into each data point.
 
Implications:
This dashboard goes beyond identifying areas for improvement; it empowers data-driven decisions to enhance overall quality. 
The one-stop hub for quality analysis ensures a holistic understanding
of our performance.
